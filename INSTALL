pytrainer basic installation
===========================

These are generic installation instructions to use with *.tar.gz files

1.- Dependency Overview

Here are the dependencies for pytrainer. Of course you must have a working environment
with proper shell configuration and typical GNU tools to uncompress (gunzip) and untar
(tar) files.

1.1.- Packages

Required Python packages and their versions can be seen in pyproject.toml. Additionally
the Python bindings for gobject-introspection and Cairo are required, as are the gir
bindings for GTK. For map functionality the gir bindings for WebKit2 are also required.

- Only needed if correspondent plugin or extension is enabled:
gpsbabel == 1.3.5 ("GoogleEarth" and "Garmin via GPSBabel 1.3.5" aka "garmin_hr")
garmintools >= 0.10 ("Import from Garmin GPS device (via garmintools)" aka "garmintools_full" plugin)
wordpresslib (already distributed within pytrainer tarball, wordpress extension)
httplib2 >= 0.6.0 (wordpress extension)
SOAPpy >= 0.11.6 (dotclear extension)
GDAL (Elevation correction, via "gdal-python" or "python-gdal")
perl (garmin-fit plugin, tested with perl v5.16.2 on Fedora 18, see ticket #5)

2.- Installation process

Copy tarball file to a location where you have write and execution rights (e.g. /tmp or
your $HOME directory). Make sure executables are under your $PATH.

$ tar -xzf pytrainer-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
$ cd pytrainer-X.Y.Z
$ sudo python setup.py install
$ pytrainer -i

For more information about the process, please check http://docs.python.org/distutils/setupscript.html

3.- USB access

pytrainer can use gpsbabel (http://www.gpsbabel.org) to retrieve information from Garmin
devices. There are some problems regarding driver to access usb ports, please take a look
at http://www.gpsbabel.org/os/Linux_Hotplug.html
