Some notes about manpage for pytrainer:

Current source manpage is unfortunately _not_ automatically generated.

To test how man page will look like, just execute: 
	
	$ groff -Tascii -man manpage_pytrainer.src

It is not clear which one is the right path to store man pages. On Fedora 15, it is under /usr/share/man, but output from manpath command adds /usr/local/share/man that is empty.

Manual installations instructions would be (pytrainer would match section 7, miscellaneous):

$ cp <manpage source file> pytrainer.7
$ gzip pytrainer.7
$ sudo cp pytrainer.7.gz <man_path>/man7/

This installation process needs to be as automated as possible to get integrated with python distutils
