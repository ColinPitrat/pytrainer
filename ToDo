Added from Pierre's email:

- Equipment management :
Ability to store a list of equipment (running shoes, ...) and associate it (or not) with records. It is to follow how many km have been done with some shoes for example.

- Laps information :
This have been discussed before and it seems to be a bit difficult to implement. None of the gpsbabel format catch this information from the watch.
Do you know this project http://code.google.com/p/garmintools/ ? Binary information and not in python but all data seems to be extracted. Could be the base for a new import plugin with addtionnal functionnalities.

- Graph improvement:
Many things here... Curve smoothing option. Ability to zoom in and out. Select a portion of track and extract some simple statistics information (avg speed, hr, max hr, Total Ascent, ...)
