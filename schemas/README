This folder contains the schemas that are relevant to pytrainer 
(though they are NOT all supported yet)

The schemas are:
Topografix_gpx11.xsd - The base GPX schema from Topografix (version 1.1)
Cluetrust_gpxdata10.xsd - The Cluetrust (also known as GPXDATA) extensions used by pytrainer for heartrate (and lap) support
GarminTrainingCenterDatabase_v1.xsd - Garmin Training Center version 1 
GarminTrainingCenterDatabase_v2.xsd - Garmin Training Center version 2 (TCX) 

Internally pytrainer uses Topografix_gpx11.xsd with Cluetrust_gpxdata10.xsd extensions

validate_gpsfile.py is a command line tool that allows files to be validated against the schemas (requires lxml)
Usage: validate_gpsfile.py [options] filename

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s SCHEMA, --schema=SCHEMA
                        specify schema to validate FILE against
  -v, --verbose         show extra information (including why validation
                        fails)

If a schema is not specified the tool will try to validate against all four schemas
